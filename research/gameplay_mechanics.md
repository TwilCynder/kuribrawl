# Dash cancelling
i.e. any mechanic that allow a player to perform an action directly during a dash, without having to go in dash_stop.  
Defines how characters can act out of dash, which in turn defines how viable dashing is as a movement option.  

## In melee
Dashes can be cancelled by jumps, crouchs and shields. It is important to note that some of the momentum of the dash is kept (the x speed is not set to an entirely fixed value) when jumping.  

## Jump
Jump is the most common dash cancel option, as it will always be available when running.  
The most important thing aabout the viability of jumps as a dash-cancelling option is what the jumpsquat can be cancelled into, and what can be performed immediately after leaving the ground, since all of these options will be available out of dash.  
It is also important to define how much X speed can be kept/gained when jumping, as fixed and/or low X speeds after a jump significantly hinders the mobility of a fighter using this option.
