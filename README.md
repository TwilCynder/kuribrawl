# kuribrawl
A platform fighter (fighting game with a platforming aspect) inspired by Rivals of Aether, and of course Super Smash Bros.

Written in C++ with my own engine (only me, my gcc and the SDL library), the game aims to have an extensive Mod support (allowing anyone to create their characters), using Lua scripts.

Gameplay-wise, Kuribrawl aims to be "fun while technical", like some kind of a bit more technical Rivals of Aether. 
The game (and by that i mean a decent gaming exeprience, fun-wise) should be accessible for anyone without experience of fighting games, however the goal is to
reward high levels of skill at platform fighters if the game is played with a competitive intent, with a high skill ceiling.
